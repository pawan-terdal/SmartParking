# SmartParking
## An IoT based smart parking solution 

The proposed Smart Parking system consists of an on-site deployment of an IoT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space.

A mobile application is  provided that allows an end user to check the availability of parking space and book a parking slot accordingly.

Smart parking helps one of the biggest problems on driving in urban areas; finding empty parking spaces and controlling illegal parking. It also simplifies the parking experience and adds value for parking stakeholders, such as drivers and merchants.
